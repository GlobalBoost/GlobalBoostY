What is Globalboost?
----------------

Globalboost-Y is a version of Bitcoin using yescrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 10 minutes block targets
 - 24 Millions total coins
 
 - base58.h PUBKEY_ADDRESS = 77, // Globalboost addresses start with Y
  - src/protocol.h port: return testnet ? 18226 : 8226; 
 - src/init.cpp " -port=<port>           " + _("Listen for connections on <port> (default: 8226 or testnet: 18226)") + "\n" +
 - src/bitcoinrpc.cpp    return GetBoolArg("-testnet", false) ? 18225 : 8225;
 - src/main.h max coin and dPriority
 - Set the genesis block in src/main.cpp LoadBlockIndex paraphrase (pszTimestamp) to any recent news phase. get the latest unix time (do a google), and put in block.nTime. set any nNonce (doesn't really matter)
 - src/base58.h PUBKEY_ADDRESS = 77, // Globalboost-Y addresses start with Y
 - src/sendcoinsentry.cpp     ui->payTo->setPlaceholderText(tr("Enter a Globalboost address (e.g. YD4QQy97AftstTofTR3vdUD2pLkt3K4Z77)"));
 - change example in signverifymessagedialog.cpp     ui->addressIn_SM->setPlaceholderText(tr("Enter a Globalboost-Y address (e.g. YD4QQy97AftstTofTR3vdUD2pLkt3K4Z77)"));
 - Checkpoint: you want to disable the checkpoint check initially, otherwise you may get stuck. You have multiple ways to disable it, my way is: open checkpoints.cpp there are 3 functions, comment out the normal return, and make them return either true, 0, or null.

Globalboost is released under the terms of the MIT license. See `COPYING` for more

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Globalboost
development team members simply pulls it.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/GlobalBoost/GlobalBoost-Y/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Globalboost.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake GLOBALBOOST_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test globalboost-y.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./globalboost-qt_test
